# FileGenics
Coding project that autosorts files to different folders with an indicated path

You will have to have python installed, and a python library called PyQt5 to work with the interface correctly, to intall it just type pip install PyQt5 in a Command Promt Window, if your python is installed correctly that should work.

You need to download the FileGenics.zip folder and extract the files, then inside the files just double click the fileGenicsUI.py file to open the graphic interface.

Inside the interface you will have to type the path of the desired folder to sort, and if you wish to sort some other files different to the preselected files there is an option for that in the interface where you need to type the new folder name and the extensions you need inside that folder.
